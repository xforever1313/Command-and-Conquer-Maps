# Command and Conquer Maps

These are a collection of maps I've made over the years for various Command and Conquer games.

Full disclosure: A lot of these maps are bad, unbalanced, or even unfinished.  But, I wanted to post them in case anyone wanted to try them out for science (and also so I don't lose them).

Install instructions and a description of each map is located in each game's directory's Readme.md file.
